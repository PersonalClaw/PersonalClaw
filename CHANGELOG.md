## [Unreleased]

Forward-looking work is tracked in [docs/roadmap/](docs/roadmap/roadmap.md).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-26

The **safety-and-resilience** release: the autonomy guardrails program (kill switch,
spend budgets, denylist, outbound scanning, named safety profiles), the full Platform
Resilience program (Doctor health probes, no-model degraded mode, mid-turn message
policy, confirm-gated fixes + trust simulators + crash capture, and a health-scored
self-maintenance engine), first-party apps in the Store on a plain install, the
legibility surfaces (self-documenting UI kit, Discover, routed project context, offline
agent reference), and a render-smoke gate that closes the v0.1.0 blank-dashboard hole.

### Added

- **One health-scored maintenance engine replaces scattered upkeep.**
- **The Doctor can now fix what it finds, explain what it surfaces, and remember what crashed.**
- **Mid-turn message policy: queue (default) or cancel-and-replace.**
- **No-model degraded mode: the assistant stays useful, and honest, with no model bound.**
- **A Doctor tab now diagnoses every subsystem from one read-only view.**
- **First-party apps now appear in the Store on a plain install.**
- **Every non-interactive model call now passes through one guarded seam.**
- **Unattended spend now has budgets, and outbound prompts are scanned for secrets.**
- **A kill switch, a path/action denylist, and a live-write guard for unattended work.**
- **A Guardrails settings surface, a provider-health view, and named safety profiles.**
- **The animated dot-wave backdrop is now a choosable background style.**
- **PersonalClaw describes its own UI kit, guides you to the parts of itself you haven't tried, and hands external agents a routed project context.**
- **Apps surface their skills and backend routes to the agent (declared, not discovered).**
- **Offline agent reference + `pclaw-api` skill**

### Changed

- **The dashboard's system indicators are now a docked bottom rail.**
